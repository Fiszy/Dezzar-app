# Dezzar-app
Deezer, is a music website app that displays the different types of music that allow users to play and listen to a song.

Thought Process;
I started off by making a quick pen sketch or wireframe, went through the api documentation to understand the problem i'm to solve and  facilitate my working process.
Implementation of the given design was done with React. I set up the terminal and ran,
npx create-react-app -deezar
After the installation process was complete i opened the project in my IDE using, npm start.
The Visual studio code comprises of different folders, both  in the root folder and src folder.
I structured my layout in the HOC component as to help me get children properties displayed in a smooth manner.
I created .env file in the root folder housing the application details that are require for the project.
Going through the documentation, i did alot of research to figure out and understand how the api is to be integrated,tested the api on Postman,got a demo access,
used useState and useEffect Hooks by passing the api using fetch(), a GET method and headers.
